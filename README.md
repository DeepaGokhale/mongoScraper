# mongoScraper
mongoScraper scrapes articles from a site

1. You can scrape/clip  more documents
2. You can click "Enter Notes" to add notes to the specific article and also delete an article
3. When you clik the link on the article it will open the article for you to read more than the title/short description you see

4. I tried working on the show the notes and delete them but could not complete it in timely manner. I plan to attend the office hour solving this to help me finish the notes. Currently it saves (creates notes but it is not adding the title or description in it)
